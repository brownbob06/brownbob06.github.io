This show should have been released on Friday, but LoOoDaXFactor spilled a Four Loco all over the central computer here in the situation room and it took all weekend to clean up.  This was a live show from Friday, where I called homeowners who weren't home and told them that I was in the process of cutting down all their trees.

I completely forget who told me to repost last year's Halloween afterparty, but here it is, for all you people who are too lazy to scroll back a year and listen to this yourselves. 

Default Cecil sponsors today's live show, and it is 100% his fault that I played Jewel's Foolish Games at least a dozen times in 2.5 hours.  Luckily for you podcast listeners, I've cut most of that all out so I don't get sued.  Thanks, Incognetoe and Aussie Jack for the numbers I called in this show.  I don't really hate them as much as I seem in this show.  Just a little.

Today we call a few home owners who've put up stolen Halloween decorations, we throw peoples mail in front of a bulldozer, and we mildly annoy a youth pastor.  All this is thanks to today's show sponsor, Kuraz.  When you think of youth pastors dealing drugs, think of Kuraz.

I tried to put together a new show today, but things didn't work out so I'm saying fuck it and just posting an old show instead.  This one is from April 27th, 2015, and some guy, possibly from Louisiana, recently suggested THIS SHOW as something people need to hear again.  So if you don't enjoy this show, it's entirely that guy's fault.  Hopefully I'll be able to get a new show put together this weekend.

Mr. Taco sponsors the beginning of the end of Dingtember 2016 so basically he's partially to blame for the end of Dingtember.  In today's show we learn that getting your car fixed in a timely manner is a higher priority than stopping child slavery.  The ending song is Debaser the Cat by Emergency Pizza Party.

Mr. Taco sponsors the beginning of the end of Dingtember 2016 so basically he's partially to blame for the end of Dingtember.  In today's show we learn that getting your car fixed in a timely manner is a higher priority than stopping child slavery.  The ending song is Debaser the Cat by Emergency Pizza Party.

What is this weird, short thing showing up on your feed?  Why I'm glad you asked.  Today Kuraz brings you a brand new thing known as Hobosodes.  Every hobosode will be less than 15 minutes long and will only contain a few short things, such as a prank call or 2 and maybe a voicemail if we have time.  The hobosodes will only show up on the private podcast feed, so you better go to phonelosers.org/cactus and set that up.  The purpose of hobosodes is to give more content to the supporters of the show and, ironically, less to the hobos that don't support the show.  If all goes well, you should get at least 1 hobosode per week in addition to the 2 regular shows I do, but I'm a known liar so don't believe any of that.  The music in today's hobosode is King of the Road by Roger Miller, They Won't Get Me, also by Roger, and the background music was that weird monkey song by Gorillaz.

			<description>
Don't get your hopes up, because this is an old show that originally aired on November 8th, 2013.  It's a tribute to the store we all once loved, until we all started mocking it for being old and pointless.  In this show you'll get to hear some attempts to shut down Blockbusters early, during the weeks before they were all about to shut down anyway.  You'll also hear a Blockbuster corporate phone conference, where a corporate lady tells 180 store managers how to maximize their profits before they all get fired.

Don't get your hopes up, because this is an old show that originally aired on November 8th, 2013.  It's a tribute to the store we all once loved, until we all started mocking it for being old and pointless.  In this show you'll get to hear some attempts to shut down Blockbusters early, during the weeks before they were all about to shut down anyway.  You'll also hear a Blockbuster corporate phone conference, where a corporate lady tells 180 store managers how to maximize their profits before they all get fired.

Here's a live show that happened last week, sponsored by Honey Baby.  This is the sequel to the schooner show that happened the day before, but I was lazy about getting it edited since I thought it sucked.  Blame Honey Baby.

Mike U sponsors today's live show.  It's his fault that I fell off a few roofs, dragging Chad down with me once, and that I'll never see my beloved childhood porn collection OR my dead pets again, and it's his fault that white people refuse to apologize for their actions against me.  Thanks, Mike U.

Rhapsodyman2000 is responsible for today's show falling a full 10 minutes short of our usual 1 hour goal.  Thanks a lot Rhapsodyman2000!  In today's show, you'll learn the original true meaning of the word cactus, we call a lunk and a pot hole complainer and we find out that people rarely care when I try to distract them.

Today's show refuses not to be religious, so don't blame me for it.  Blame Miguel F, who is today's sponsor.  In today's show you'll hear me lose my weed pipe AGAIN, and then I get lectured by a guy who worships Shania Twain or something like that.
